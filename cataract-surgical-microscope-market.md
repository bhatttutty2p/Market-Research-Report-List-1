<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cataract Surgical Microscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Monitor</li><li>Without Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cataract surgical microscope market is divided into two main types: with monitor and without monitor. Microscopes with a monitor feature a built-in or external display that enhances visualization, allowing surgeons to share images and provide better guidance during procedures. In contrast, microscopes without monitors rely solely on the traditional ocular lenses for viewing, focusing directly on the surgical site. Both types serve specialized surgical needs, influencing selection based on surgeon preference, procedure requirements, and technical capabilities.</p></p>
