<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agglomeration Drums Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet</li><li>Dry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agglomeration drums are specialized equipment used in the processing of materials through agglomeration, which combines smaller particles into a larger mass. The market can be categorized into two main types: wet and dry. Wet agglomeration drums utilize moisture or binding agents to form granules, ideal for products requiring higher cohesion and uniformity. In contrast, dry agglomeration drums rely on mechanical forces or heat without moisture, making them suitable for materials that cannot tolerate water or need minimal processing.</p></p>
